# VedicRecon v1.0.a

VedicRecon is a lightweight, modular reconnaissance tool designed to simplify and automate the most repetitive phases of information gathering. Built for pentesters, cybersecurity learners, and bug-bounty hunters, it focuses on clarity, structure, and meaningful output.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Reconnaissance often becomes noisy, scattered, and inefficient due to multiple tools, different scan modes, and unorganized results. VedicRecon aims to bring everything into one clean workflow:

- Host discovery  
- Port and service enumeration  
- OS and version detection  
- Exploit reference gathering  
- Report generation  

It is especially useful for beginners who want an easy, guided structure, and for intermediate testers who want fast, scriptable recon.
